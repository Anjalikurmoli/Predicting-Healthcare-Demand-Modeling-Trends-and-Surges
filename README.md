# Predicting-Healthcare-Demand-Modeling-Trends-and-Surges
Predicting resource allocation is crucial for various sectors, particularly healthcare. Effective distribution and utilization of resources become especially vital during national and international epidemic outbreaks, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing historical healthcare data enables better preparedness and management of similar future outbreaks by informing how hospital resources—such as ICU beds, ventilators, and medical personnel—should be allocated during emergencies. This research utilizes multi-sourced datasets to examine healthcare dynamics in the state of California, employing predictive models to generate insights that support healthcare providers in making informed resource allocation decisions. By leveraging advanced analytics, this study aims to enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of healthcare systems, ensuring optimal inpatient and ICU bed utilization during periods of fluctuating demand.
